% Data preparation for the different tests for the RELM framework
%
% Input parameters:
%   vRatesH         Matrix with rates of the test hypothesis
%   vRatesN         Matrix with rates of the null hypothesis
%   fMagThreshold   Magnitude threshold (Use only bins with magnitude >= threshold
%
% Output paramters:
%   vLambdaH        Vector containing expected rates for the test hypothesis
%   vLambdaN        Vector containing expected rates for the null hypothesis
%   vNumberQuake    Vector containing the observed numbers of events
