2012.05.30
==========
Version 0.10. Updating for the latest release of numpy.

2009.03.26
==========
Version 0.09. A remaining reference to _statistics was replaced by
_transcendental, following a bug report by Dean Provins.

2008.12.18
==========
Version 0.08. Removed the remaining functions from Numeric. Released the
wrapper code under the Python license; the licensing status of the Cephes
library itself is unclear to me.

2008.12.05
==========
Version 0.07. Modified test functions that are no longer needed with current
Python versions. Changing from Numerical Python to NumPy.

2007.03.06
==========
Version 0.06. Using a config.h script instead of compile-time arguments.
Removing the specialized error message for transcendental.

2004.06.08
==========
Version 0.05. Added the RPM package specification in python-transcendental.spec,
which was kindly provided by Simon Clift of the University of Waterloo, Canada.

2004.03.01
==========
Version 0.04. Rewrote the code in arch.c, which is used when running "python
setup.py config" to check the computer architecture, in particular the format
of floating point numbers. This check is now more comprehensive and strict. The
architecture check was now tested on a computer with a DEC-type architecture.
Previously, only the IBMPC and MIEEE checks were tested (on a Windows machine
and on Mac OS X, respectively).

2003.12.19
==========
Version 0.03. Bug fix. Some mathematical libraries, notably on Unix and Linux,
contain a function called gamma, which is the logarithm of the gamma function
instead of the gamma function itself. Incorrect answers occurred when Cephes
called the gamma function in the math library instead of its own gamma function,
which does not include the logarithm. This was fixed by renaming the gamma
function in the Cephes library to cephesgamma. If a function gamma is found in
the math library that really is the gamma function, then cephesgamma is
#defined to gamma.

2003.07.15
==========
Version 0.02. Expanded the set of available functions. Changed the name of
the extension module to transcendental.

2003.04.06
==========
Version 0.01. Originated at the University of Tokyo, Institute of Medical
Science, Human Genome Center, Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis. Our
first, rather modest, goal is to get access to the erf error function, either
from the standard math library, or, if we cannot find it there, from the cephes
routine.
